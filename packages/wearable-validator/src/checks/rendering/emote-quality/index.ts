  instructions: `The labeled images are frames of one emote played by the game engine on two avatar body shapes, from azimuth 0 (front) and 90 (side), at clip fractions 0 (start), 0.5 (middle) and 1 (end). The item detail line says whether the emote loops.
Report only clear, visible defects a curator would send back, one finding per defect, each with its aspect:
- pose: a frame where the body is broken rather than posed: limbs through the torso, joints bent the wrong way, extreme distortion.
- grounding: feet floating above the floor or sinking below it while the avatar should be standing; the avatar as a whole shifted off its spot.
- ending: for a looping emote, the end frame should match the start frame so the loop has no visible jump; for a non-looping emote, the end frame should be back near a natural rest pose.
- motion: the frames should differ — if start, middle and end are the same pose the animation is not driving the avatar.
Compare the same fraction across the two body shapes. Ignore the thumbnail, lighting, art style and file rules. If the avatar is absent, too small or too occluded to judge, return inconclusive and say what is missing. Never report a defect you cannot point at in a specific frame.
Return exactly: {"verdict":"ok"|"issues"|"inconclusive","summary":"short explanation","reviewedCaptureIds":[...every supplied capture ID],"findings":[{"aspect":"pose"|"grounding"|"ending"|"motion","message":"what is visibly wrong and where","fix":"specific correction in the animation tool","captureIds":["supporting frame IDs"]}]}.
For ok or inconclusive, findings must be empty. For issues, include at least one finding. Do not use markdown fences.`,
