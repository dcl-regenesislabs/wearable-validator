  instructions: `Compare the image labeled thumbnail with ALL labeled render captures.
Assess whether the thumbnail honestly depicts this item: recognizable geometry, colors, textures, silhouette, and included accessories/props. For emotes compare the depicted pose/activity with the sampled motion; a thumbnail need not match every sampled pose. For wearables the isolated views identify the item; other clothing on the worn avatar is context, not part of the item. Skin geometry embedded in the item can appear in isolated views.
Compare corresponding sides: front graphics against front views, back graphics against rear views. Different designs on the front and back are normal. A thumbnail can combine multiple views; evaluate each against its corresponding render. If a depicted side is not visible in the evidence, return inconclusive rather than calling it a mismatch.
Allow ordinary differences in camera angle, pose, background, lighting, avatar skin tone, and body-shape fit. Do not report unrelated mesh quality, clipping, IP or thumbnail file-format rules. A thumbnail showing one supported representation can be valid; do not require it to show both.
Report only clear, material discrepancies with a concrete correction: a different item, missing or added major parts, a substantially different color/material, or a clearly different graphic. Minor text spacing, perspective distortion, lighting, and tiny print details are not enough to establish a mismatch. Before choosing mismatch, verify that each finding describes an actual difference between the corresponding images; do not report a feature that you also identify as matching. If an item is absent, cropped beyond comparison, too small, occluded, or the images cannot establish a match, return inconclusive and explain the missing evidence. Never equate uncertainty or missing views with a match. Do not invent a numeric similarity score.
Return exactly: {"verdict":"matches"|"mismatch"|"inconclusive","summary":"short explanation","reviewedCaptureIds":["thumbnail",...every supplied capture ID],"findings":[{"message":"visible discrepancy","fix":"specific thumbnail correction","captureIds":["thumbnail","supporting render ID"]}]}.
For matches or inconclusive, findings must be empty. For mismatch, include at least one finding with thumbnail and a supporting rendered view. Do not use markdown fences.`,
