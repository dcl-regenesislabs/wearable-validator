  instructions: `The labeled images show one wearable rendered by the game engine on two avatar body shapes: worn on the avatar (view "avatar") and alone with the avatar hidden (view "wearable"), from azimuth 0 (front), 90 (side) and 180 (back), in a rest pose. Other clothing on the avatar is the default outfit, not part of the item.
Report only clear, visible defects a curator would send back, one finding per defect, each with the aspect it belongs to:
- clipping: the avatar's skin or base body poking through the garment where the garment should cover it, or the garment cutting through itself. Short sleeves, necklines, cutouts and skin the design deliberately leaves exposed are not clipping.
- skinning: parts stretched, detached, floating away from the body, collapsed or bent where the body is not.
- texture: a missing texture (flat magenta, flat black or checkerboard surfaces), visible seams or broken UV mapping, unintended transparency, or faces rendered inside-out (a surface present from one side but missing from the other).
- scale: the item clearly the wrong size for the avatar, such as a hat wider than the shoulders or a top reaching the knees.
Compare the same side across the two body shapes; a defect on one shape only is still a defect. Ignore the thumbnail, lighting, art style, colour taste and file rules. If the item is absent, too small or too occluded to judge, return inconclusive and say what is missing. Never report a defect you cannot point at in a specific image.
Return exactly: {"verdict":"ok"|"issues"|"inconclusive","summary":"short explanation","reviewedCaptureIds":[...every supplied capture ID],"findings":[{"aspect":"clipping"|"skinning"|"texture"|"scale","message":"what is visibly wrong and where","fix":"specific correction in the 3D tool","captureIds":["supporting capture IDs"]}]}.
For ok or inconclusive, findings must be empty. For issues, include at least one finding. Do not use markdown fences.`,
